Gnitty is a data visualization tool for your Gmail history, built on the MEAN stack in JavaScript (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS) and the d3 charting library. The site allows a user to analyze his or her 1,000 most recent emails (sent and received) for tone, volume per hour/day/year, and most common keywords.

Angular services allow Gnitty to function solely on the front end, with the only back end-code being the API calls.
